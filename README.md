A minimal, responsive, and Vim‚Äëinspired mouse/navigation controller for macOS.

---

## ‚ú® What is this?

This is a **Vim‚Äëstyle keyboard navigation system for macOS**, powered by [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org).  
It lets you **control your mouse, inputs, screens, and window focus** without ever reaching for your trackpad or mouse.

This config includes:

- üñ±Ô∏è One‚Äëtap screen switching with `‚å•` (Option) or `‚åÉ` (Control) ‚Äì **outside nav mode**
- üß≠ A full **NAV MODE** for mouse movement, input clicking, scrolling, screen‚Äëedge jumping, and app textbox navigation
- üñ•Ô∏è Support for multi‚Äëmonitor setups
- ‚ö° Lightweight, pragmatic, and easy to edit
- üß† Inspired by Vim and modal editors

**Tip:** `‚å•` and `‚åÉ` actions are triggered on **key release**, so they don‚Äôt interfere with regular macOS shortcuts.
