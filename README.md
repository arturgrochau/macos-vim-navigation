A minimal, responsive, and Vim‚Äëinspired mouse/navigation controller for macOS.

---

## ‚ú® What is this?

This is a **Vim‚Äëstyle keyboard navigation system for macOS**, powered by [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org).  
It lets you **control your mouse, inputs, screens, and window focus** without ever reaching for your trackpad or mouse.

This config includes:

- üñ±Ô∏è One‚Äëtap screen switching with `‚å•` (Option) or `‚åÉ` (Control) ‚Äì **outside nav mode**
- üß≠ A full **NAV MODE** for mouse movement, input clicking, scrolling, screen‚Äëedge jumping, and app textbox navigation
- üñ•Ô∏è Support for multi‚Äëmonitor setups
- ‚ö° Lightweight, pragmatic, and easy to edit
- üß† Inspired by Vim and modal editors

**Tip:** `‚å•` and `‚åÉ` actions are triggered on **key release**, so they don‚Äôt interfere with regular macOS shortcuts.

### üîÄ Moving and Selecting (while in Visual Mode)

In visual mode, selection is extended as the mouse moves or scrolls. Keys behave with different granularities:

| Key / Combo       | Action                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h / j / k / l`   | Move mouse in small steps (1/8th of screen width/height)               |
| `‚Üë / ‚Üì / ‚Üê / ‚Üí`   | Arrow keys: same as `k / j / h / l` (extend selection while moving)    |
| `H / J / K / L`   | Move mouse in large steps (1/2 of screen width/height)                 |
| `u / d`           | Move cursor vertically in moderate steps (while extending selection)   |
| `w / b`           | Move cursor horizontally in moderate steps (while extending selection) |
| `Shift + U/D/W/B` | Scroll significantly (8√ó step) in the corresponding direction          |

### üìå Notes

- `-- VISUAL MODE --` overlay appears when active
- Triple-click block selection starts with `Shift + v`
- Exiting visual mode clicks to finalize the selection
- Visual mode auto-exits when leaving nav mode
- Works seamlessly with copy (`y`) and paste (`p`) operations
- `Shift + U/D/W/B` extend selection while scrolling, but may not activate until the cursor has moved‚Äîuse `h/j/k/l` once first to ensure highlighting starts
